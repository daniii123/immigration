  <h3>Laws</h3>
    <p id="p01"> </p>
    <p class="big">Immigration laws determine who is allowed into the country and how long they can stay. The laws also control what they can do during their time in the country. Immigrants have their rights to be in the country however, many immigrants do not know their rights.</p>
    <p></p>
  <h3>Amendments</h3>
    <p id="p01"> </p>
    <p class="big">The US constitutional laws are applied to undocumented immigrants. Immigrants have their rights. Many parts of the amendments states "people" or "person" instead of "citizen".
      The fifth amendment - The right to due process</p>
    <p></p>

(assylum services are an exception) </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p class="big">The sixth amendment - The right to legal counsel: This connects to immigrants because a lot of the time when people dont speak english they are takem advantage of, sometimes immigrants need to have a hearing so the judges know exactly why theyre here.</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid" style="background-color:white">
    <ul>

        <li class="big"style="background-color: white;color:#708090;font-size:24px">Because most deportation processes are civil rather than criminal cases, the right to legal counsel often does not apply.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p class="big">The 14th and 15th amendment - The right to vote or hold office: A person who has become a U.S citizen has the right to vote and hold office. </p>

    <p class="big">4th amendment - right against unreasonable search and seizure: When ICE agents show up at an undocumented persons house, they have the right to not let them in without a warrant signed by a judge. With fear, people dont know what they're entitled to.  </p>

  <h3>Protection</h3>
    <p id="p01"> </p>
    <p class="big">President Trump has enforced many controversial and problematic actions and plans during his presidency such as building a wall along the mexican us border, deportation of millions of immigrants in the us, ect . Although the government can deny legal rights the "ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project is working on expanding and enforcing the civil liberties and civil rights of immigrants and to combating public and private discrimination against them". This is one of the many organizations that fight for undocumented immigrants.</p>
