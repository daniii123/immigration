  <h3>Green cards/ DACA/ Visa's</h3>
    <p id="p01"> </p>
    <p class="big">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is an immigration policy created by former US president Barack Obama. It allows people who came to the United States illegally as a child to stay without threat of deportation. </p>
    <p class="big">Legal permanent residents, also known as the Green Card, allows people to work and live in the United States legally. People are given the freedom to stay in the US for however long they want.There are 6 different types of green cards:
Employment-Based Green Cards, Family Green Cards, Marriage-Based Green Cards, EB-5 Investment Cards, DV- Lottery Cards, and Special Immigrants.</p>
    <p class="big">There are two types of Visas: Immigrant and Nonimmigrant. Immigrant Visa is for people who intended to live and work permanently in the United States. Nonimmigrant Visa is for people who want to stay in the country temporarily. For example, tourism, business, school,  medical treatment and certain types of temporary work.
The US has a Visa Waiver Program (VWP) which allows citizens of certain countries to come to the US for 90 days without a visa.</p>

  <h3>Stereotypes</h3>
    <p id="p01"> </p>
    <p class="big">The general concern around undocumented immigrants today is the assumption that they will bring drugs, crime, and corruption. Immigrants and undocumented immigrants, specifically those from Latin America, are proceved as "rapists" and "violent criminals and murders", whereas immigrants from the Middle East have been misconceived as "terrorists". During his presidential campaign, President Trump, made claims to ban any further immigration of Muslims to the U.S. Similar anti-immigrant sentiments are found throughout Europe and Africa. This caused terrorism within the United States towards Latino and Muslim people from white supremacist.</p>
