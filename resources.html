  <h3>Health care</h3>
    <p id="p01"> </p>
    <p class="big">Providing undocumented immigrants with health care has been nearly supported by all the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Commonly known health services like Medicaid and Medicare are not accessible for undocumented immigrants. They're also unable to purchase insurance through the marketplaces set up by the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Undocumented children do not qualify for the Children's Health Insurance Program, commonly known as CHIP. Many of them receive primary care and prescription drugs for a sliding-scale fee at 1,400 federally funded health care centers spread across 11,000 communities. Those centers are required to treat anyone, regardless of ability to pay, and administrators do not ask patients about their citizenship status.</p>
    <p></p>
  <h3>Schools</h3>

    <p id="p01"> </p>
    <p class="big">In the United States, immigrants are allowed to have the same education opportunities as non-immigrants. The number of immigrants receiving a bachelor's degree or higher has been increasing over the past years. Although education opportunities may be available for immigrants, students with an immigration status face many more challenges. Immigrant students face racial stereotypes from their peers.</p>
    <p class="big">McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act provides help for homeless immigrant students regardless of their status. Under law, immigrant students, even undocumented or non-citizens, are given the right to have public education.</p>
    <p></p>


  <h3>Employment</h3>
    <p id="p01"> </p>
    <p class="big">One of the main reasons people from across the world immigrate to the United States is for the American dream. A dream defined by prosperity, hope that someday you'll be able to have food without having to worry about the cost, to have a job with not having to look under rocks, and to have a family with no fear of violence around.</p>
    <p class="big">Most of the time the first thing done by immigrants once they arrive, is search for a job. Many immigrants work from under the table because they aren't residents or official citizens, therefore it isn't actually legal to work. Immigrants face challenges such as not speaking english or struggling to get adjusted to a new society as well as getting adjusted to living without family and customs left behind.</p>
    <p class="big">Once immigrants start working they often face prejudice and discrimination from others, sadly, immigrants are forced to put up with employment injustices. Undocumented workers are among those who are most likely to face discrimination on a job and abuse from their employers. Many work in low-paying or dangerous occupations, such as domestic work, construction, agriculture and food service.</p>

    <p class="big"style="background-color: white;color:black;font-size:27px">Employers may take advantage of their undocumented status in the following ways:</p>

    <div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid" style="background-color:white">
    <ul>
      <li class="big"style="background-color: white;color:#708090;font-size:24px">Forcing workers to labor long hours without paying overtime</li>
      <li class="big"style="background-color: white;color:#708090;font-size:24px">Not paying minimum wage or failing to compensate for work that is done under the table</li>
      <li class="big"style="background-color: white;color:#708090;font-size:24px">Not offering job training or protective equipment for dangerous jobs</li>
      <li class="big"style="background-color: white;color:#708090;font-size:24px">Failing to let workers know of their legal rights</li>
      <li class="big"style="background-color: white;color:#708090;font-size:24px">Not allowing workers to unionize</li>
      <li class="big"style="background-color: white;color:#708090;font-size:24px">Engaging in racial discrimination or sexual harassment</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    <p></p>

    <p class="big">If workers complain about their job conditions, demand fair wages or ask for the right to join a union, unscrupulous employers may retaliate by cutting wages further or threatening to call immigration authorities.</p>
    <p class="big">As a result finding a stable job may be difficult for many, however many organizations/companies offer information and employment for those who most need it.</p>
